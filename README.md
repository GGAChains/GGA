# GGA Chain

## Introduction to GGA Chain
GGA Chain (GGA) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high- performance transactions. 

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, GGA's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, GGA is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and GGA will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## GGA Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Support Plan of GGA
### Financial Support
- GGA will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- GGA will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on GGA Dapp, the GGA meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding GGA in a step-wise manner.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from GGA have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in GGA global roadshows for free.
- GGA fund will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.

## Risk Warning
- All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of GGA for free, and there is no charging scenario.
- All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
